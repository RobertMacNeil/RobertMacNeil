Hello, I'm Robert

Programming has been a hobby of mine and I continually strive to improve in it.
Along with programming I enjoy coming up with new ideas and working on designing and documenting them.

Experience:
I have a bit of experience in C# and TypeScript. I have also worked with the Unity Game Engine.

Personal Projects:
Currently working on building my portfolio and will be updating this when I do.
